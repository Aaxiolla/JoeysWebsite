<main>
    <p>I am a student currently studying for my A-levels in 2025 at St Ivo sixth form in cambridgeshire. I am currently studying mathematics, further mathematics, computer science and economics. I have had a lifelong interest and passion for maths and I have more recently become very interested in computer science. I am most interested in neural networks as well as the maths underlying and the potential economic impact that AI could have.</p> 
    <p>Although I am planning to study computer science after sixth form, I am aiming to persue all of my subjects to as high of a level as I can.</p>

    <br>
    <p> It is 2014 and I have no idea what is going on in my life!<br></p>

    <p>Hello hello hello hello<br>It should be easier than this<br>We should fit like a glove and a hand<br></p>
    <p>Hey, space cadet<br>The things you see inside your head<br>You'd better make other plans instead<br></p>    
    <p>Hey, space cadet<br>It's alright to want to dream<br>It doesn't mean reality is mean<br></p>
    <p> Hey, space cadet<br>It's time to show them what you can do<br>What can you do, man, what can you do?<br></p>
    <p> Hey, space cadet<br>Hey, space cadet<br>Love isn't love enough?<br>Love isn't love even at all<br>Love isn't love enough?<br>Love isn't love even at all<br>Love isn't love enough?<br>Love isn't love even at all<br>At all, at all, at all, at all<br>At all, at all, at all, at all<br>At all<br></p>
